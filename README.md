# UsePopCornApp built with React JS and External API

I have built a website using an external API, OMDB API. I learned

- How to use do state management with the **useState** hook?
- How to use fetch data from API using the **useEffect** hook?
- How to hold data and select DOM elements in React using the **useRef** hook?
- How to create custom hooks using existing HOOks?

Here is the Resultant website I have built
